# Basic-C-Sharp-Projects:
 These are small C# and ASP.net projects I've worked on:

**6part.cs** (loops, conditionals, collections, and user input)

**ACCOUNTING.cs **(simple console application that prints a welcome message)

**Console.App.As.cs **(basic arithmetic operations, user input, type conversion, and Console output in C#)

**Program.cs **(Entity Framework Code-First console app that initializes a DbContext with Student and Grade tables, adds new students, deletes students with specific IDs and lists all students in the database.)

**branching.cs **(Greets the user, takes input for weight, width, height, and length. Displays the result as a formatted dollar amount and calculates quote with formula.)

**integer.cs **(User input with try catch blocks, division output, loop until valid input which keeps the user from crashing it with a typo)

**methodclass.cs **(class with a method that takes parameters)

**operators.cs **(Class design, operator overloading (==, !=), null checks, Overriding Equals() and GetHashCode())

**polymorph.cs **(assigning Employee object to an IQuittable reference, Interface implementation (IQuittable), Class using an interface)
